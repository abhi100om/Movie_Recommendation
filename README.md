# Movie_Recommendation_System
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built in Python. It recommends movies based on a user's preferences, such as their previously watched movies or specific movie genres. The system uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach, allowing flexibility for different recommendation methods.

# Features
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user behavior (e.g., ratings, watched history).
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to a specific movie by analyzing its features (e.g., genre, director, cast).
Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more personalized recommendations.
